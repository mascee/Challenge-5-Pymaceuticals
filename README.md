### SCC tumor study, focus on Capomulin. Analysis.

    A study on 249 mice identified with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer, recieved treatment with a range of drug regiments. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured.  The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

    Capomulin treatment shows results similar to the drug Ramicane, with tumor volume decreasing over time. If compared to other treatments both Capomulin and Ramicane performed significantly better then other treatments, with tumor size shrinking over time. It is a positve finding, as we see that even with upper outlier in the study of Capomulin, it shrank the tumor better then other drug (but similar to Ramicane). It means that if Ramicane doesn't work on a patient, or produces side effects, we can use Capomulin to achive simlar results.

    Overall, if we compare means of all drugs, Capomulin showed lower tumor size compared to other drugs (but similar to Ramicane).

    Compared to Placebo, Capomuline showed significantly better tumor shinkage.

    If we compare size of mice with tumor size, we see positive correlation, meaning that tumor size increases with mass. Correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume: 0.84 showing strong correlation. It could be a significate finding, but at the same time it could be just correlation. We have to keep in mind that body parts also increase with size.

    This study was performed on roughly equal parts of male and female mice.

    Considering that even though the total number of mice studied was 249, the study on each drug was performed on only 25 mice and this study is relativly small. We have to keep this in mind for predicting accuracy. Overall great results for Capomulin.
